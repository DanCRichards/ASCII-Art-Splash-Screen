ASCII Art Splash Screen
=======================
Automatically presents ASCII art to you when you open terminal and changes "Randomly"

-----

How to get this working
===========================

This tutorial is for unix based systems #Sorry Windows. Also if you need this tutorial you probably shouldn't be using terminal.

 1. Download the `ascii.py` file and install it at your home directory. 
 2. Open Terminal 
 3. Type `cd` to ensure you're at the home directory
 4. Type `nano .bash_profile` (I prefer you use vim, but you probably can't exit it or know how to go up or down - I have linked a nice tutorial that I used to learn VIM. It's nice when you know how to fully use it) 
 5. Use arrow keys to add at the bottom `python3 ascii.py`
 6. Exit nano by pressing `Ctrl + x` then `y` then `<Enter Key>`
 7. Restart Terminal
