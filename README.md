#SCII Art Splash Screen 

Automatically presents ASCII art to you when you open terminal and changes "Randomly"

-----

##How to get this working 
This tutorial is for unix based systems #Sorry Windows. Also if you need this tutorial you probably shouldn't be using terminal.
	1. Download the `ascii.py` file and install it at your home directory. 
	2. Open terminal
	2. Type `cd` to ensure you're at the home directory
	3. Type `nano .bash_profile` (I prefer you use vim, but not everyone knows how to use vim (or exit of that matter)
	4. Using the arrow keys and add at the bottom `python3 ascii.py`
	5. Exit nano by pressing: `Ctrl + x` then `y` then `<Enter Key>`
   6.  Restart Terminal
